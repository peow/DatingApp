# Introduction

This repository contains the project called "DatingApp". The DatingApp is a social platform where you can find the love of your life. 

This is not my project, it's based on a udemy course "[Build an app with ASPNET Core and Angular from scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/)"

# Goals

1. complete the course

4. implement unit tests - Client
5. implement integration tests (optional)
